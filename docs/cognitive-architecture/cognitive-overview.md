# Cognitive Architecture Overview and Design Principles

FBA-Bench's enhanced cognitive architecture provides agents with advanced reasoning capabilities, including hierarchical planning, structured reflection, and robust memory management. This overview details the core components and their design philosophy.

## Core Components
- **Hierarchical Planner**: Enables agents to formulate long-term strategies and decompose them into actionable sub-goals.
- **Reflection Module**: Allows agents to learn from past experiences by reviewing simulation outcomes, identifying discrepancies, and generating insights.
- **Memory System**: Manages agent knowledge, ensuring consistency, validity, and efficient retrieval of information.

## Design Principles

### Modularity
Each cognitive component is designed as a distinct, interchangeable module. This promotes flexibility, allowing researchers to experiment with different planning algorithms, reflection strategies, or memory architectures without impacting other parts of the system.

### Observability
The cognitive processes are instrumented to provide detailed traces and logs, enabling deep analysis of agent thought processes, decisions, and learning progress. This is crucial for understanding `why` an agent acted in a certain way.

### Configurability
The behavior of each cognitive component is highly configurable via YAML files. This includes parameters for planning depth, reflection frequency, memory validation rigor, and more, allowing for fine-grained control over agent intelligence.

### Scalability
Designed to work efficiently in distributed simulation environments, ensuring that cognitive overhead does not become a bottleneck when running large-scale experiments with many agents.

## Integration with Agent Core

The cognitive components seamlessly integrate with the main agent controllers (e.g., [`agents/advanced_agent.py`](agents/advanced_agent.py) and [`agents/multi_domain_controller.py`](agents/multi_domain_controller.py)), enabling a flexible `plug-and-play` approach to building intelligent agents.
