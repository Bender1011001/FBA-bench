# Production Deployment Best Practices

Deploying FBA-Bench in a production environment, especially when integrating with real-world marketplaces, requires careful consideration of security, reliability, monitoring, and maintenance. This guide outlines best practices for running FBA-Bench in a robust and safe production setup.

## 1. Security Considerations

-   **API Key Management**: Never hardcode API keys or sensitive credentials directly in code or configuration files. Use environment variables, Kubernetes Secrets, or a dedicated secret management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
-   **Least Privilege**: Configure IAM roles or service accounts with the absolute minimum permissions required for FBA-Bench components to function.
-   **Network Segmentation**: Deploy FBA-Bench components in private subnets and use firewalls/security groups to restrict network access only to necessary ports and services.
-   **Input Validation**: Ensure all inputs to agent actions (especially those going to live APIs) are rigorously validated to prevent injection attacks or malformed data.
-   **Code Audits**: Regularly audit your custom agent code and skill modules for security vulnerabilities.

## 2. Infrastructure Reliability and Scalability

-   **Containerization**: Always deploy FBA-Bench components as Docker containers. This ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
-   **Orchestration**: Use Kubernetes (or similar container orchestrator like Docker Swarm) for production deployments. Kubernetes provides:
    -   **Auto-healing**: Automatically restarts failed containers.
    -   **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across agent runners.
    -   **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**: Dynamically scales agent runner pods based on resource utilization or custom metrics.
-   **Distributed Event Bus**: Utilize a robust, highly-available message queue (e.g., Redis, Kafka) for inter-component communication rather than local in-memory solutions.
-   **Persistent Storage**: For long-term memory, LLM caches, and trace data, use persistent storage solutions (e.g., Kubernetes Persistent Volumes, cloud storage buckets, managed databases) that are backed up and replicated.
-   **Resource Limits and Requests**: Set appropriate CPU and memory `limits` and `requests` in your Kubernetes deployment manifests to prevent resource contention and ensure stable performance.

## 3. Monitoring and Maintenance

-   **Centralized Logging**: Aggregate logs from all FBA-Bench components into a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK Stack, Datadog Logs, Splunk). This enables easier debugging and auditing.
-   **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Beyond FBA-Bench's internal [`Performance Monitoring`](../infrastructure/monitoring-and-alerts.md), integrate with external monitoring systems (e.g., Prometheus + Grafana, Datadog, New Relic) to track:
    -   Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O)
    -   Application metrics (LLM token usage, API latencies, simulation throughput)
    -   Business KPIs (net profit, sales, inventory levels)
-   **Alerting**: Configure robust [`Alerts`](../infrastructure/monitoring-and-alerts.md) for critical situations (e.g., LLM rate limits, significant profit drops, system errors, resource exhaustion). Integrate alerts with PagerDuty, Slack, or email for immediate notification.
-   **Trace Analysis**: Regularly review detailed [`simulation traces`](../observability/trace-analysis.md) to understand agent behavior and identify areas for improvement or potential risks.
-   **Regular Backups**: Implement automated backup and recovery procedures for all critical data, including persistent memories, golden masters, and experiment results.
-   **Dependency Management**: Keep your Python packages (from `requirements.txt`) and Docker base images updated to benefit from security patches and performance improvements.

## 4. Agent Lifecycle Management in Production

When running agents that interact with real-world systems, establish a clear lifecycle:

-   **Staging/Sandbox Environments**: Always test new agent versions or configurations in a high-fidelity staging environment mirroring production, ideally using the `dry_run_mode` in [`RealWorldAdapter`](../api-reference/integration-api.md).
-   **Gradual Rollouts/Canary Deployments**: Deploy new agent versions to a small subset of the production traffic first, monitoring performance closely before a full rollout.
-   **Kill Switches and Circuit Breakers**: Implement mechanisms to immediately disable an agent's real-world actions or fall back to a safe, default behavior if unexpected issues arise. FBA-Bench's `safety_constraints` in `integration_config.yaml` provide built-in safeguards.
-   **Manual Interventions**: Have a process for human oversight and potential manual intervention if an agent behaves erratically or outside defined safety bounds. Integrate with `manual_review_queue_endpoint` as defined in `integration_config.yaml`.
-   **Automated Rollback**: Consider enabling `auto_rollback_on_critical_alert` in your integration config, but with extreme caution and thorough testing.

By following these best practices, you can confidently run FBA-Bench for continuous agent evaluation and safe real-world deployment.
