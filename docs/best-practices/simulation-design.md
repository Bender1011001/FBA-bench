# Designing Effective Simulation Experiments

Designing a robust simulation experiment in FBA-Bench goes beyond simply running a scenario. It involves careful consideration of scenario selection, agent configuration, data collection, and reproducibility to yield meaningful and scientifically rigorous results.

## 1. Define Clear Research Questions/Objectives

Before running any simulation, clearly articulate what you aim to achieve or discover:
-   Are you evaluating a new agent architecture? If so, what specific capabilities are you testing (e.g., planning under uncertainty, multi-skill coordination)?
-   Are you benchmarking different LLM models?
-   Are you exploring agent behavior under specific market conditions?
-   Are you trying to reproduce a known-good result?

Clear objectives will guide your scenario, agent, and data collection choices.

## 2. Strategic Scenario Selection and Configuration

-   **Start Simple, Increase Complexity**: Begin with [`Tier 0 (T0) baseline scenarios`](../scenarios/curriculum-design.md) to validate basic functionality. Gradually progress to higher tiers (T1, T2, T3) or use dynamically generated scenarios (`docs/scenarios/dynamic-generation.md`) to challenge agents with increasing complexity.
-   **Targeted Scenarios**: Choose or create scenarios ([`Scenario System Overview`](../scenarios/scenario-system.md)) that directly test your research question. For example, if testing financial acumen, use scenarios with clear financial metrics and events impacting profitability.
-   **Multi-Agent Dynamics**: If your research involves agent interaction, leverage [`Multi-Agent Scenarios`](../scenarios/multi-agent-scenarios.md) to simulate cooperative or competitive environments.
-   **Curriculum-Based Runs**: For agent training or progressive evaluation, structure your experiments using the [`Curriculum Design`](../scenarios/curriculum-design.md) capabilities.

## 3. Agent Configuration and Parameter Management

-   **Isolate Variables**: When comparing agents or LLM models, keep all other parameters (scenario, environmental settings, other agent configurations) as constant as possible to isolate the impact of your variable under test.
-   **Cognitive Tuning**: Explore the impact of different `cognitive-config` settings ([`Cognitive System Configuration`](../configuration/cognitive-config.md)) on agent performance for your chosen scenario.
-   **Skill Tuning**: For multi-skill agents, experiment with different `skill-config` arrangements ([`Multi-Skill Agent Configuration`](../configuration/skill-config.md)) and coordination strategies.
-   **Version Control for Configs**: Treat your configuration files (YAMLs) as code. Store them in version control (Git) alongside your agent implementations to ensure reproducibility.

## 4. Performance and Scalability Considerations

-   **Resource Allocation**: Plan your compute resources based on the scale of your simulations. For large runs, utilize FBA-Bench's [`Distributed Simulation`](../infrastructure/distributed-simulation.md) capabilities.
-   **Cost Optimization**: Actively manage LLM costs using techniques like [`LLM Batching and Cost Optimization`](../infrastructure/performance-optimization.md) and smart LLM model selection. Review `llm_cost_metrics` regularly.
-   **Fast-Forwarding**: For very long simulations, strategically use `fast-forward` features to accelerate less critical periods.
-   **Monitoring**: Use [`System Monitoring and Performance Tracking`](../infrastructure/monitoring-and-alerts.md) to observe resource utilization and identify bottlenecks.

## 5. Reproducibility and Scientific Rigor

Reproducibility is paramount for reliable scientific experimentation. FBA-Bench provides several features to ensure this:

-   **LLM Caching (`reproducibility/llm_cache.py`)**: Crucial for ensuring that identical LLM prompts yield identical (cached) responses across runs.
-   **Simulation Seeding (`reproducibility/sim_seed.py`)**: Use a fixed seed for random number generators in stochastic parts of the simulation to ensure deterministic outcomes for the simulation environment.
-   **Golden Master Testing (`reproducibility/golden_master.py`)**: Establish known-good simulation traces (golden masters) for your baseline scenarios. Compare new runs against these masters to detect unintended deviations.
-   **Trace Logging**: Ensure comprehensive tracing is enabled ([`Advanced Trace Analysis`](../observability/trace-analysis.md)) to capture detailed run history, allowing for post-hoc analysis and debugging of inconsistencies.
-   **Version Control**: Always version control your agent code, scenario definitions, and key configuration files. Document the exact versions used for each experiment.

## 6. Data Collection and Analysis

-   **Comprehensive Metrics**: Utilize the full suite of FBA-Bench metrics (financial, cognitive, operational, trust, red team) to capture a holistic view of agent performance.
-   **Trace Analysis**: After simulations, use the `TraceAnalyzer` to drill down into agent decision-making processes. Look for patterns, common failure modes, or moments of exceptional performance.
-   **Reporting**: Generate structured [`performance reports`](../infrastructure/monitoring-and-alerts.md) and [`validation reports`](../scenarios/scenario-validation.md) to summarize results.
-   **Iterate**: Use insights from analysis to refine your agents, scenarios, or experimental design for the next iteration.

By rigorously applying these best practices, you can maximize the value of your FBA-Bench experiments and contribute to robust agent research.
