# Best Practices for Designing Effective Agents

Designing effective agents in FBA-Bench is a blend of art and science, combining careful configuration of cognitive and skill modules with a deep understanding of the simulation environment. This guide provides best practices for developing agents that are robust, adaptable, and perform well across diverse scenarios.

## 1. Define Clear Agent Objectives and Capabilities

-   **Scenario-Specific Goals**: Clearly understand the goals of the scenario and how your agent's actions will contribute to or detract from them. Tailor your agent's strategic and tactical planning accordingly.
-   **Skill Alignment**: For multi-skill agents, ensure that the enabled skills accurately reflect the functional areas required by the scenario. Avoid enabling unnecessary skills, as they add overhead.
-   **LLM Role Definition**: Explicitly define the role of the LLM within each agent component (e.g., for high-level reasoning, specific tool use, or reflection).

## 2. Optimize Cognitive Architecture

### Hierarchical Planning
-   **Appropriate Depth**: Choose a planning `depth` that matches the complexity of the long-term challenges in your scenarios. Too shallow, and the agent might be myopic; too deep, and it might be computationally expensive.
-   **Realistic Goal Horizons**: Set `goal_horizon` and `replan_frequency` to match the natural cycles of the business domain in your simulation (e.g., quarterly for financial planning, daily for pricing adjustments).
-   **Iterative Refinement**: Use the insights from reflection to refine planning prompts or strategy definitions.

### Structured Reflection
-   **Meaningful Frequency**: Configure `reflection.frequency` to align with significant breakpoints in the simulation (e.g., end of quarter, after major events) where a review of performance is most beneficial.
-   **Actionable Insights**: Design reflection prompts that encourage the LLM to generate specific, actionable insights, not just descriptive summaries.
-   **Feedback Loop**: Ensure `feedback_loop_enabled` is `true` to allow insights to genuinely influence future planning and behavior.

### Memory Management
-   **Relevant Context**: Design your agent to store and retrieve only the most relevant information in its memory. Overloading memory can lead to distraction or increased LLM context window usage.
-   **Validation and Consistency**: Keep `memory.validation` and `memory.consistency_checks` enabled. This is crucial for maintaining a coherent understanding of the environment, especially over long simulation runs.
-   **Pruning Strategy**: Configure a `forgetting_strategy` and `max_memory_size` appropriate for your agent's needs to prevent memory bloat and maintain efficiency.

## 3. Configure Multi-Skill Agents Effectively

-   **Balanced Skill Set**: Select a set of `enabled_skills` that provides comprehensive coverage for the scenario's demands without excessive redundancy.
-   **Clear Skill Responsibilities**: Ensure each skill module has a well-defined domain of responsibility to avoid overlapping or conflicting actions.
-   **Robust Coordination**: Choose a `conflict_resolution_strategy` that aligns with your agent's overarching objectives. For critical production deployments, consider `llm_mediated` resolution with careful prompt engineering for complex conflicts.
-   **Skill-Specific LLM Models**: Use the `skills` section in `skill_config.yaml` to specify different LLM models for different skills. For instance, a financially sensitive skill might use a more powerful (and expensive) model, while a simple data-querying skill might use a cheaper one.

## 4. Optimize LLM Interactions

-   **Prompt Engineering**: This is paramount.
    -   **Be Concise**: Remove filler words, redundant instructions, and unnecessary conversational elements.
    -   **Be Specific**: Clearly define inputs, outputs, and constraints. Use JSON or Pydantic schemas for structured outputs.
    -   **Use Examples**: Provide a few high-quality, relevant examples of input-output pairs to guide behavior.
    -   **Chain of Thought**: For complex reasoning, ask the LLM to show its thought process before the final answer.
-   **Model Temperature**: Use lower temperatures (e.g., 0.1-0.5) for tasks requiring determinism and precision (e.g., data extraction, logical reasoning) and higher temperatures (e.g., 0.7-1.0) for creative tasks (e.g., marketing slogans, brainstorming).
-   **Token Limits**: Set realistic `max_tokens` for LLM responses to control costs and prevent runaway generation.

## 5. Embrace Iterative Design and Testing

-   **Start Simple**: Begin with basic agents and T0 scenarios. Gradually introduce complexity (T1, T2, T3) as your agent's capabilities improve.
-   **Traces and Observability**: Deeply leverage FBA-Bench's trace analysis and observability dashboards. Understanding *how* your agent is thinking and *why* it's failing is more important than just knowing *that* it failed.
-   **Golden Master Testing**: For critical agent behaviors, capture golden master traces to ensure reproducibility and detect regressions after changes.
-   **A/B Testing**: Run parallel simulations with different agent configurations to compare their performance systematically.

By adhering to these best practices, you can design and evolve highly effective and insightful agents within the FBA-Bench environment.
