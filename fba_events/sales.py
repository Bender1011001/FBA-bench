"""
Event definitions related to sales transactions within the FBA-Bench simulation.

This module defines the `SaleOccurred` event, which is the primary mechanism
for signaling completed sales. This event carries comprehensive details about
each transaction, including financial metrics, product information, and market
conditions at the time of sale. It is crucial for downstream services for
financial auditing, performance tracking, and behavioral analysis.

    """
    Signals the completion of a sales transaction within the simulation.
    Published by a `SalesService` or equivalent component.
    
    This event carries comprehensive transaction details, including financial data,
    product information, and relevant market conditions that were present at the
    time of sale. It's crucial for financial auditing, agent performance tracking,
    and overall simulation metrics.
    
    Attributes:
        event_id (str): Unique identifier for this specific sale event. Inherited from `BaseEvent`.
        timestamp (datetime): The real-world UTC datetime when the sale was successfully processed.
                              Inherited from `BaseEvent`.
        asin (str): The Amazon Standard Identification Number of the product sold.
        units_sold (int): The number of units of the product sold in this transaction.
        units_demanded (int): The total number of units demanded,
                               used to calculate the effective conversion rate.
        unit_price (Money): The price per unit at which the sale occurred.
        total_revenue (Money): Gross revenue from this sale (`units_sold * unit_price`).
        total_fees (Money): Total fees deducted from the revenue.
                            (e.g., marketplace fees, referral fees, fulfillment fees).
        total_profit (Money): Net profit after fees and cost of goods sold
                              (`revenue - fees - costs_basis`).
        cost_basis (Money): The total cost associated with the `units_sold`
                            (e.g., cost of goods, inbound shipping).
        trust_score_at_sale (float): The product's trust score or reputation metric
                                     at the time of the sale (0.0 to 1.0).
        bsr_at_sale (int): The Best Seller Rank of the product at the time of the sale.
                           (lower is better, e.g., BSR of 1).
        conversion_rate (float): The conversion rate for this transaction
                                 (`units_sold / units_demanded`). Auto-calculated if 0.0 and `units_demanded` > 0.
        fee_breakdown (Dict[str, Money]): A detailed breakdown of all fees applied, by type.
                                          Keys are fee names (e.g., 'referral_fee'), values are `Money` amounts.
        market_conditions (Dict[str, Any]): A snapshot of the market state at the time of sale,
                                            containing relevant data like average competitor prices, demand elasticity.
        customer_segment (Optional[str]): The segment of the customer who made the purchase (if known),
                                          e.g., 'premium', 'loyal', 'new'.
