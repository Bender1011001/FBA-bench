"""
Event definitions related to time progression and simulation state in the FBA-Bench simulation.

This module defines `TickEvent`, the fundamental heartbeat of the simulation
that drives all time-dependent processes.

These events are central to the simulation's progress and the coordination
of all time-sensitive logic across various services and agents.

    Represents the advancement of simulation time by one discrete step.
    Published by the `SimulationOrchestrator` at each time increment.
    
    This is the fundamental heartbeat of the FBA-Bench simulation. Its regular
    publication triggers all time-dependent processes and services to advance
    their internal states and perform actions relevant to the current simulation tick.
    
    Attributes:
        event_id (str): Unique identifier for this specific tick event. Inherited from `BaseEvent`.
        timestamp (datetime): The real-world UTC datetime when this tick event was processed/published.
                              Inherited from `BaseEvent`.
        tick_number (int): A sequential counter for the simulation ticks, starting from 0.
                           Represents the cumulative number of time steps taken.
        simulation_time (datetime): The logical simulation time corresponding to this tick.

                                    depending on the simulation's time granularity.

                                    or special simulation phases. Defaults to an empty dictionary.
