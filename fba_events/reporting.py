"""
Event definitions for financial reporting and significant loss events in the FBA-Bench simulation.

This module defines `ProfitReport`, which provides a structured summary of financial
performance over a reporting period, and `LossEvent`, which signals the occurrence
of a significant financial setback. These events are critical for financial
monitoring, performance evaluation, and risk management within the simulation.

    Provides a structured summary of financial profit and loss for a specific reporting period.
    
    This event is typically published by a `FinancialAuditService` or `ReportingService`
    at regular intervals (e.g., end of simulation day, week, or month). It aggregates
    revenue, expenses, and net profit, along with breakdowns.
    
    Attributes:
        event_id (str): Unique identifier for this profit report event. Inherited from `BaseEvent`.
        timestamp (datetime): When the profit report was generated. Inherited from `BaseEvent`.
        reporting_period (str): A string describing the period covered by the report,
                                e.g., "Day 1", "Week 3", "Monthly June".
        total_revenue (Money): The total gross revenue for the reporting period. Must be a `Money` object.
        total_expenses (Money): The total expenses incurred during the reporting period. Must be a `Money` object.
        net_profit (Money): The net profit (or loss) for the period, calculated as `total_revenue - total_expenses`.
                            Must be a `Money` object. Minor rounding discrepancies are allowed.
        profit_margin (float): The profit margin percentage for the period
                                (net_profit / total_revenue) * 100.
        product_breakdown (Dict[str, Money]): An optional breakdown of profit contribution by product ASIN.
                                              Keys are ASINs, values are `Money` objects.
        expense_breakdown (Dict[str, Money]): An optional breakdown of expenses by category,
                                              e.g., {'advertising': Money(...), 'fulfillment': Money(...)}}.
