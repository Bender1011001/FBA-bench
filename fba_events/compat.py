"""
Compatibility layer for legacy event imports.

This module re-exports canonical classes from fba_events while emitting a
DeprecationWarning on import. Prefer importing directly from fba_events.*
modules or fba_events registry-based exports.

Legacy code that previously imported from various locations can import from
fba_events.compat during the migration period.

Exports:
- BaseEvent
- TickEvent
- SetPriceCommand
- SaleOccurred
- ProductPriceUpdated
- CompetitorPricesUpdated
- CompetitorState
