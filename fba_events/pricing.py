"""
Event definitions related to product pricing within the FBA-Bench simulation.

This module defines `SetPriceCommand`, an agent-issued command to change prices,
and `ProductPriceUpdated`, a canonical event signaling an official price change.
These events are central to the dynamic pricing strategies of agents and
the overall market simulation.
