Event and data definitions related to competitor dynamics in the FBA-Bench simulation.

This module defines `CompetitorState` for capturing competitor metrics and
`CompetitorPricesUpdated` event to signal changes in the competitive landscape.
These are crucial for agents to perform market analysis and adjust their

    A compact snapshot of a competitor's key performance metrics at a given time.

                   higher sales performance (e.g., BSR of 1 is the best).
        sales_velocity (float): The estimated current sales velocity of the competitor's
