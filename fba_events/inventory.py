Event definitions related to inventory management and world state snapshots in the FBA-Bench simulation.

This module defines `InventoryUpdate` to track changes in product quantities,
`LowInventoryEvent` to signal when stock levels are critical, and
`WorldStateSnapshotEvent` for periodic comprehensive captures of the simulation's
overall state. These events are essential for operational oversight,
replenishment decisions, and historical analysis.

    Signals a change in a product's canonical inventory quantity.

    This event is published by the `WorldStore` whenever the official

    result of sales, customer returns, or the arrival of inbound shipments.
