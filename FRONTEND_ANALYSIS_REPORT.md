## Technical Debt Assessment

**Current State**: The codebase demonstrates good architectural patterns and comprehensive type safety, but suffers from incomplete production readiness.

**Maintainability**: Good - Well-structured components with clear separation of concerns

**Scalability**: Moderate - Some performance bottlenecks identified that need addressing

**Security**: Needs Improvement - Several security concerns identified

**Production Readiness**: Not Ready - Critical issues must be resolved before production deployment

## Conclusion

The FBA-Bench frontend GUI has a solid foundation with excellent type safety and component architecture. However, **47 identified issues** must be addressed before production deployment. The most critical concerns are the missing real API integration, race conditions, and memory leaks. Once these issues are resolved, the application will provide a robust platform for financial benchmark analysis.

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks for critical fixes, 4-6 weeks for complete issue resolution

**Priority Order**: 
1. Critical issues (immediate)
2. High severity issues (week 1-2)
3. Medium severity issues (week 3-4)
4. Low severity issues (ongoing maintenance)
