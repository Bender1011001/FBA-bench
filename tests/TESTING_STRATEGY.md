# FBA-Bench Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for FBA-Bench, ensuring robust validation of all components, features, and functionality. The testing framework is designed to provide high confidence in the reliability, performance, and correctness of the benchmarking system.

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing philosophy is based on the following principles:

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Tests are written before or alongside implementation to ensure requirements are clearly understood and met.
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All code paths, components, and user interactions are tested.
3. **Automation**: All tests are automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
4. **Early Detection**: Issues are identified as early as possible in the development cycle.
5. **Continuous Improvement**: The testing framework evolves with the codebase to maintain effectiveness.

## Testing Pyramid

We follow a testing pyramid approach with the following distribution:

- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Fast, isolated tests of individual components.
- **Integration Tests (20%)**: Tests that verify interactions between components.
- **End-to-End Tests (10%)**: Tests that simulate real user scenarios.

## Test Categories

### 5. Frontend Tests

**Location**: `tests/frontend/`

**Purpose**: Test frontend components and user interactions.

**Components Tested**:

- Accessibility and usability

**Frameworks**:
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `Jest`, `React Testing Library`, `Cypress` for E2E tests
- Accessibility: `axe-core` for accessibility testing

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Sources

1. **Synthetic Data**: Programmatically generated data for edge cases and boundary conditions.
2. **Real-world Data Samples**: Anonymized and sanitized data from real scenarios.
3. **Performance Benchmark Data**: Standardized datasets for performance comparisons.
4. **Validation Datasets**: Datasets with known outcomes for validation testing.

### Test Data Management Strategy

- **Versioning**: All test datasets are versioned and tracked in the repository.
- **Privacy**: Sensitive data is anonymized or synthesized.
- **Refresh Mechanism**: Automated refresh of test data on a scheduled basis.
- **Documentation**: Clear documentation of data sources and generation methods.

## Test Automation and CI/CD

### Continuous Integration

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run linters and basic unit tests before commits.
2. **Pull Request Checks**: Run full test suite with coverage reporting.
3. **Scheduled Runs**: Execute full test suite nightly and on weekends.
4. **Performance Regression Detection**: Automated performance testing on a schedule.

### Quality Gates

1. **Code Coverage**: Minimum 90% coverage for new code, 80% for existing code.
2. **Test Success Rate**: 100% of tests must pass for merge.
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: No more than 5% performance degradation allowed.
4. **Security Scans**: No high or critical security vulnerabilities allowed.

### Test Reporting

1. **Dashboard**: Real-time test results dashboard with historical trends.
2. **Notifications**: Automated alerts for test failures.
3. **Reports**: Detailed test reports with failure analysis.
4. **Metrics**: Test execution time, coverage, and stability metrics.

## Test Environment Management

### Environment Types

1. **Development**: Local development environment with fast feedback.
2. **Testing**: Dedicated testing environment that mimics production.
3. **Staging**: Pre-production environment for final validation.
4. **Production**: Production environment with limited testing.

### Environment Configuration

- **Infrastructure as Code**: All environments defined using code.
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration with environment-specific overrides.
- **Data Management**: Consistent data across environments with appropriate masking.
- **Service Dependencies**: Mocked or containerized dependencies for testing.

## Specialized Testing
