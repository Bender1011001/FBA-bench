# FBA-Bench: Benchmark Philosophy

**FBA‑Bench grades long‑horizon, multi‑role competence and robustness under stochastic shocks while enforcing exact financial integrity.**

This document establishes the philosophical foundation for FBA-Bench as a tier-1 LLM-agent benchmark, defining the principles, evaluation criteria, and design philosophy that guide all development decisions and position FBA-Bench alongside leading benchmarks like VendingBench and AgentBench.

## Executive Summary

FBA-Bench represents a paradigm shift in agent evaluation, moving beyond static knowledge tests to dynamic, high-fidelity simulations that probe the deepest challenges in autonomous agent development: sustained coherence, strategic reasoning, and cognitive resilience under pressure. Built on a foundation of uncompromising financial integrity and deterministic reproducibility, FBA-Bench creates a crucible where agents must demonstrate not just intelligence, but the kind of robust, long-term competence required for real-world deployment.

## Four Pillars of Excellence

What separates a tier-1 benchmark from lesser evaluation frameworks? Our analysis reveals four critical dimensions that define benchmark quality:

### 1. Multi-dimensional Measurement
**Beyond Single KPIs to Holistic Competence**

- **Inferior Benchmarks** measure raw next-token prediction skill in isolation
- **Adequate Benchmarks** focus on single metrics like net profit
- **Tier-1 Benchmarks** evaluate across multiple dimensions: financial performance, operational health, compliance adherence, and cognitive resilience

FBA-Bench implements a comprehensive scoring framework that captures the full spectrum of business competence:
- **Financial Acumen** (25%): Resilient net worth under market volatility
- **Operational Excellence** (15%): Inventory optimization and supply chain management
- **Marketing Effectiveness** (10%): ROI-driven advertising and conversion optimization
- **Trust & Compliance** (10%): Regulatory adherence and customer satisfaction
- **Cognitive Resilience** (15%): Sustained attention and goal coherence under stress
- **Stress Recovery** (15%): Mean time to recovery after external shocks
- **Resource Efficiency** (10%): Token consumption and computational cost

### 2. Instrumented Root-cause Analysis
**From Anecdotes to Systematic Diagnosis**

- **Inferior Benchmarks** provide opaque failure modes with no diagnostic insight
- **Adequate Benchmarks** rely on anecdotal observations and manual analysis
- **Tier-1 Benchmarks** instrument failure modes systematically, enabling precise diagnosis of agent breakdowns

FBA-Bench captures and categorizes failure modes:
- **State Misinterpretation**: Agent builds incorrect world models from valid data
- **Hallucinated Actions**: Agent attempts impossible or invalid operations
- **Cognitive Meltdown**: Catastrophic degradation of reasoning quality over time
- **Resource Mismanagement**: Inefficient allocation of computational or financial resources
- **Temporal Inconsistency**: Failure to maintain coherent goals across time horizons

### 3. Deterministic Reproducibility
**From RNG Chaos to Scientific Rigor**

- **Inferior Benchmarks** exhibit non-deterministic behavior that prevents meaningful comparison
- **Adequate Benchmarks** use fixed seeds but with hidden scope and floating-point drift
- **Tier-1 Benchmarks** guarantee bit-perfect reproducibility through comprehensive determinism

FBA-Bench achieves scientific-grade reproducibility through:
- **Global Seed Management**: Single SimSeed propagates to all randomness sources
- **Event Stream Auditing**: Complete transaction logs with cryptographic integrity
- **Configuration Hashing**: SHA-256 fingerprints of environment, code, and parameters
- **Golden Snapshots**: Reference event streams for regression detection

### 4. First-class Extensibility
**From Hard-coded Rules to Plug-in Ecosystems**

- **Inferior Benchmarks** embed business logic in inflexible, hard-coded rules
- **Adequate Benchmarks** provide YAML configuration knobs for basic parameters
- **Tier-1 Benchmarks** implement plug-in registries enabling community-driven evolution

FBA-Bench's extensibility architecture supports:
- **Service Plug-ins**: Custom fee calculators, demand models, and market dynamics
- **Agent Frameworks**: Support for CrewAI, LangChain, AutoGen, and custom implementations
- **Event Extensions**: Community-contributed shock scenarios and market conditions
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Pluggable scoring functions and analysis frameworks

## Core Design Principles

Eight fundamental principles guide all FBA-Bench development decisions:

### 1. Financial Integrity is Non-negotiable
Every monetary transaction must satisfy fundamental accounting identities. The [`Money`](money.py) type enforces exact arithmetic, while [`FinancialAuditService`](financial_audit.py) validates `Assets = Liabilities + Equity` after every transaction. Violations halt execution immediately—there are no exceptions.

### 2. Every Agent Action Must Be Traceable and Auditable
The event-driven architecture ensures complete observability. Every agent decision flows through the [`EventBus`](event_bus.py), creating an immutable audit trail that enables post-hoc analysis, replay debugging, and scientific reproducibility.

### 3. Complexity Should Emerge from Simple Rules
Rather than implementing complex, hard-coded business logic, FBA-Bench creates emergent complexity through the interaction of simple, well-defined components. Market dynamics arise from [`competitor personas`](personas.py), demand fluctuations, and external shocks—not predetermined scripts.

### 4. Failure Modes Must Be as Informative as Success Cases
Agent failures provide crucial insights into cognitive limitations. FBA-Bench instruments common failure patterns systematically, transforming breakdowns into learning opportunities for the research community.

### 5. Deterministic Reproducibility Enables Scientific Progress
Every run must be perfectly reproducible given identical configuration. The [`audit.py`](audit.py) infrastructure ensures that sha+config ⇒ identical results, enabling rigorous A/B testing and collaborative research.

### 6. Multi-agent Isolation Prevents Information Leakage
Agents interact only through well-defined interfaces—the [`EventBus`](event_bus.py) for perception and [`SetPriceCommand`](events.py) events for actions. This sandboxing ensures fair evaluation and prevents privileged information access.

### 7. Long-term Coherence Trumps Short-term Performance
Unlike traditional benchmarks that evaluate isolated capabilities, FBA-Bench prioritizes sustained competence over extended time horizons. Agents must maintain consistent strategies across weeks of simulated time.

### 8. Cognitive Load and Resource Constraints Mirror Reality
Real-world agents operate under computational and financial constraints. FBA-Bench enforces token budgets, attention limits, and processing costs that mirror practical deployment scenarios.

## Agent Evaluation Philosophy

FBA-Bench evaluates agents across three critical dimensions that capture the essence of autonomous competence:

### Temporal Dimension: Long-horizon Coherence
Unlike traditional benchmarks that test isolated skills, FBA-Bench evaluates agents across extended time horizons:

- **T0 Baseline** (8k tokens, no memory aids): Sanity checks for basic competence
- **T1 Planning** (16k tokens, vector DB): Strategic thinking across weekly cycles  
- **T2 Adaptation** (32k tokens, full memory): Response to supply chain disruptions and market shifts
- **T3 Resilience** (128k tokens, full RAG): Recovery from cascading failures and adversarial attacks

This graduated curriculum reveals whether agents possess the sustained reasoning capabilities required for real-world deployment.

### Cognitive Dimension: Multi-role Competence
Effective business agents must juggle multiple roles simultaneously:

- **Financial Analyst**: Cash flow optimization, risk assessment, budget allocation
- **Operations Manager**: Inventory planning, supplier relationships, logistics coordination
- **Marketing Strategist**: Customer acquisition, pricing optimization, brand management
- **Compliance Officer**: Regulatory adherence, policy interpretation, risk mitigation

FBA-Bench measures role-switching fluency and the ability to balance competing priorities—capabilities that distinguish sophisticated agents from narrow specialists.

### Stress Dimension: Robustness Under Pressure
Real markets are chaotic, adversarial, and unpredictable. FBA-Bench subjects agents to systematic stress tests:

- **Market Volatility**: Sudden demand shifts, competitor price wars, seasonal fluctuations
- **Supply Chain Disruption**: Delayed shipments, quality issues, supplier bankruptcies
- **Regulatory Changes**: Fee increases, policy modifications, compliance requirements
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Review bombing, listing hijacking, social engineering attempts

The **Stress Recovery** metric measures Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) after each shock, quantifying an agent's resilience and adaptive capacity.
