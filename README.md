# FBA-Bench v3 Research Toolkit

FBA-Bench v3 is a powerful, deterministic, and scalable research toolkit designed for simulating complex financial and business scenarios, particularly in e-commerce environments (e.g., Fulfillment by Amazon - FBA). It provides a robust framework for developing, benchmarking, and analyzing the performance of AI agents and business strategies under various market conditions and adversarial events.

This toolkit emphasizes reproducibility, financial integrity, and a modular, event-driven architecture to support advanced research and rigorous analysis.

## üöÄ Features and Capabilities

*   **Deterministic Simulation Engine**: Ensures reproducible results across multiple runs and environments, critical for scientific benchmarking.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture**: Utilizes a flexible `EventBus` (`event_bus.py`) for decoupled communication, supporting both in-memory and distributed (Redis-backed) event processing.
*   **Modular Agent System**:
    *   **Skills Framework**: Agents are composed of specialized `BaseSkill` modules (`agents/skill_modules/base_skill.py`) that handle domain-specific responsibilities (e.g., `FinancialAnalystSkill`, `SupplyManagerSketch`).
    *   **Skill Coordination**: `agents/skill_coordinator.py` manages event dispatch to skills, prioritizes actions, resolves conflicts, and tracks skill performance.
    *   **Strategic Control**: `agents/multi_domain_controller.py` provides a "CEO-level" arbitration layer, aligning agent actions with high-level business objectives and managing resource allocation.
*   **Plug-and-Play LLM Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with various Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., OpenAI, OpenRouter) via a standardized `llm_interface/` for advanced reasoning and decision-making within agents.
*   **Comprehensive Scenario Management**:
    *   Define complex business scenarios and market dynamics using flexible YAML configurations (`scenarios/scenario_framework.py`).
    *   Inject external events (e.g., supply disruptions, market shifts, adversarial attacks) to test agent resilience.
*   **Rigorous Financial Auditing**: `financial_audit.py` strictly validates all financial transactions against accounting principles, ensuring data integrity and halting simulations on critical violations.
*   **Benchmarking & Evaluation**: Robust framework ([`benchmarking/`](benchmarking/)) for defining evaluation metrics, running experiments, and analyzing agent performance.
*   **Scalable Architecture**: Supports distributed simulation execution leveraging a Redis-backed `DistributedEventBus` (`infrastructure/distributed_event_bus.py`) for multi-process/multi-node deployments.
*   **RESTful API & Real-time Frontend**:
    *   `fba_bench_api/` offers a FastAPI backend for simulation control, configuration management, and real-time data streaming (via WebSockets).
    *   `frontend/` provides a React/TypeScript-based user interface for intuitive interaction, visualization, and monitoring.
*   **Toolbox API Abstraction**: `services/toolbox_api_service.py` provides a simplified interface for agents to interact with the simulation environment, decoupling agent logic from low-level event mechanisms.

**Key Interactions and Data Flow:**

1.  **Initialization**: The `experiment_cli.py` or the FastAPI application (`fba_bench_api/main.py`) initiates a simulation run, which involves the `ScenarioEngine` to load scenario configurations.
2.  **Simulation Loop**: `SimulationOrchestrator` acts as the clock, continuously emitting `TickEvent`s onto the `EventBus`.
3.  **Event Propagation**: The `EventBus` (potentially distributed via `RedisBroker` in `infrastructure/distributed_event_bus.py`) dispatches `TickEvent`s and other domain-specific `BaseEvent`s (e.g., `SaleOccurred`, `CompetitorPricesUpdated`) to all subscribed components.
4.  **Agent Decision Cycle**:
    *   `BaseSkill` modules within the Agent System receive relevant events.
    *   Skills process these events, analyze the `SkillContext` (current state, market data, etc.), possibly query LLMs via `llm_interface/`, and generate `SkillAction` proposals.
    *   The `SkillCoordinator` collects these `SkillAction`s, prioritizes them, and resolves potential conflicts.
    *   For sophisticated agents, the `MultiDomainController` applies high-level strategic alignment checks, business rules, and allocates resources before approving final actions.
    *   Approved actions are then translated into commands (e.g., `SetPriceCommand`) and sent to the `ToolboxAPIService` for execution.
5.  **World Interaction**: The `ToolboxAPIService` acts as an intermediary, receiving update commands from agents (e.g., price changes) and publishing them as new events to the `EventBus`. It also maintains a cached view of the `WorldState` (derived from `WorldStateSnapshotEvent`s or specific updates from the EventBus) that agents can "observe."
6.  **State Management & Auditing**: Core simulation state is updated by various internal services (implied by events) and the `FinancialAuditService` rigorously checks all financial transactions for integrity.
7.  **Observability & UI**: The FastAPI backend collects data and exposes it via API endpoints, including real-time WebSockets, which the React/TypeScript frontend consumes to provide live dashboards and user controls.

4.  **Database Initialization (if applicable)**:
    If using a persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL configured in `fba_bench_api/core/database.py`), ensure it's running and apply any necessary migrations. For a default SQLite setup, no explicit initialization might be needed beyond running the application.

5.  **Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example`.
    ```ini
    # .env
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key_here"
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
    FBA_BENCH_REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0" # Only needed for distributed mode
    FBA_BENCH_DB_URL="sqlite:///./fba_bench.db" # Default SQLite, can be postgresql/mysql
    ```

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables (Frontend)**:
    Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory based on `frontend/.env.example`.
    ```ini
    # frontend/.env
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000 # Adjust if your backend runs on a different port
    VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:8000/ws # Adjust if your backend runs on a different host/port
    ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage

### Running the Backend API

From the root directory of the project, with your Python virtual environment activated:

```bash
poetry run uvicorn fba_bench_api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Running the Frontend Application

From the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
npm run dev
# or yarn dev
```
The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (or similar).

### Running CLI Experiments

From the root directory of the project, with your Python virtual environment activated:

1.  **Execute an experiment sweep**:
    ```bash
    python experiment_cli.py run config/templates/benchmark_basic.yaml --parallel 4
    ```
    This command runs the experiment defined in `benchmark_basic.yaml` using 4 parallel processes. Results will be saved in a timestamped directory under `results/`.

2.  **Analyze experiment results**:
    ```bash
    python experiment_cli.py analyze results/your_experiment_name_timestamp/
    ```
    Replace `results/your_experiment_name_timestamp/` with the actual path to your experiment results directory.

### Running Tests

The project includes unit, integration, and accessibility tests for both backend and frontend components.

#### Backend Tests

From the root directory:

```bash
pytest
```
To run specific test modules or apply filters, refer to the `pytest` documentation.

#### Frontend Tests

From the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
npm test
# or yarn test
```
This will execute tests using Vitest/React Testing Library, as configured in `frontend/package.json`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Global Configuration

*   **`.env` files**: Manage API keys, database URLs, and other sensitive or environment-specific settings. Follow `.env.example` as a template.
*   **`config.yaml` / `configs/`**: Global application configurations, potentially including default parameters for simulations, agent behaviors, or infrastructure settings.

### Scenario Configuration

*   **`scenarios/`**: Defines the building blocks for simulation scenarios.
*   **`config/templates/` (e.g., `benchmark_basic.yaml`, `benchmark_advanced.yaml`)**: Examples of complete scenario configurations used by `experiment_cli.py`. These files define `scenario_name`, `difficulty_tier`, `expected_duration`, `success_criteria`, `market_conditions`, `external_events`, and `agent_constraints`.

### Agent Configuration

*   **`agents/`**: Contains various agent implementations. Agent-specific configurations are often defined within their respective modules or loaded from external YAML files. Parameters for LLM clients (models, temperatures) are configured in `llm_interface/` clients.
