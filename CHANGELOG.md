### Analysis Summary
- **Files Examined**: 15 core files + 25+ additional components
- **Lines of Code**: 3,500+ lines analyzed
- **Issues Identified**: 47 total across 4 severity levels
- **Architecture**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Zustand

### Critical Findings
1. **Missing Real API Integration** (Severity: 10)
   - All API calls currently return mock data
   - Backend integration required for production deployment

2. **Race Conditions in State Updates** (Severity: 9)
   - Concurrent state updates not properly synchronized
   - Data inconsistency risks identified

3. **Memory Leaks in WebSocket Implementation** (Severity: 9)
   - Event listeners not properly cleaned up
   - Performance degradation over time

4. **Division by Zero in Calculations** (Severity: 9)
   - No validation for zero denominators
   - Application crash potential with NaN/Infinity values

### Issue Breakdown by Severity
- **Critical (9-10)**: 4 issues - Require immediate attention
- **High (7-8)**: 7 issues - Must fix before production
- **Medium (5-6)**: 8 issues - Performance and UX improvements
- **Low (1-4)**: 28 issues - Technical debt and maintenance

### Architecture Assessment
**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive type system with TypeScript
- Well-structured component architecture
- Real-time capabilities through WebSocket integration
- Proper separation of concerns

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Production API integration needed
- Performance optimizations required
- Security enhancements necessary
- Error handling improvements

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate (Week 1-2)**: Address critical and high severity issues
2. **Short-term (Week 3-4)**: Implement medium severity fixes
3. **Long-term**: Ongoing technical debt reduction

### Recommendations
- Implement real backend API integration
- Add comprehensive error boundaries
- Optimize performance with React.memo and virtual scrolling
- Enhance security with input validation and sanitization
- Add proper offline handling and state synchronization
