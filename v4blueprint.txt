Below is a “zero‑BS” blueprint for turning FBA‑Bench into a tier‑1 LLM‑agent benchmark—on par with Vending‑Bench 
arXiv
 and AgentBench 
arXiv
GitHub
 but purpose‑built for Amazon FBA complexity. I break it into the 13 levers you can still pull, with blunt trade‑offs and concrete implementation moves.

1 · Define the North Star
Axis	Bad Bench	OK Bench	Great Bench
What it measures	Raw next‑token skill	Single KPI (net profit)	Multi‑dimensional: profit, ops health, compliance, cognitive resilience
Why it fails agents	Opaque	Anecdotes	Instrumented root‑cause (state misinterpretation, hallucinated orders, meltdown)
Repeatability	RNG chaos	“seed=42” but hidden floating scope	Deterministic event stream replay + config hash audit
Extensibility	Hard‑coded rules	YAML knobs	First‑class plug‑in registry (services, agents, events)

Move
Write a one‑pager titled Benchmark Philosophy.md that states:

“FBA‑Bench grades long‑horizon, multi‑role competence and robustness under stochastic shocks while enforcing exact financial integrity.”

Everything else hangs off that.

2 · Lock Down Ground‑Truth & Reproducibility
Deterministic Seeds: one global SimSeed; every RNG (NumPy, Python, random.Random, your volatility calc) derives its stream from it.

Golden Event Snapshots: after each CI build, dump the full event bus to artifacts/<git‑sha>.parquet. Use it in regression tests—if an unrelated pull request changes the event stream, you fail CI.

Audit Hashes: finish _generate_code_hash() / _generate_config_hash() so every run emits a SHA‑256 over (a) env variables, (b) YAML config, (c) git tree. Repro means sha+config ⇒ identical results, period.

3 · Gradient‑of‑Difficulty Curriculum
Tier	Agent Window	Memory Aid	Shocks	Purpose
T0	8k tokens	None	Off	Sanity baseline (e.g. GPT‑4o should pass)
T1	16k	Vector DB	Weekend demand oscillation	Test planning >7 days
T2	32k	Vector DB + scratchpad	Fee hike + supplier delay	Stress cash‑flow, supply‑chain
T3	128k	Full RAG	Review‑bomb + listing hijack + fee hike chain	Evaluate cognitive resilience

Move: encode the curriculum as templated YAMLs (scenarios/tier_*.yaml). CI runs all tiers against baseline bots and uploads a scoreboard.

4 · Metric Suite 2.0
Domain	Metric	Weight
Finance	Resilient Net Worth	25 %
Ops	Inventory Turn & Stock‑out %	15 %
Marketing	Weighted ROAS / ACoS	10 %
Trust/Compliance	Violation‑free days & buyer feedback	10 %
Cognitive	CRA (planned‑goal attention)	15 %
Stress Recovery	MTTR after each injected shock	15 %
Cost	Tokens / $ consumed	negative 5 %

Add a JSON output contract:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "score": 0‑100,
  "breakdown": { "finance": 22.3, "ops": 11.9, ... },
  "cost_usd": 4.76,
  "token_usage": 2_140_567
}
Everything must be computable offline from the event log—no subjective manual grading.

5 · Agent Constraints & Budget Enforcement
Attention & Compute Budget already meters tool calls—extend it:

max_prompt_tokens_per_tick

max_total_tokens_per_sim

Inject remaining_budget into every prompt so the LLM must reason about cost.

Hard‑fail over‑budget runs → negative MTTR and penalize the final score.

6 · LLM Interface Contract
Event → Prompt adapter converts the delta state to a concise JSON + natural‑language header.

Required output schema (JSON) so you can json.loads() with no text parsing.

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "actions": [
    { "type": "set_price", "asin": "B07X", "price": 23.47 },
    { "type": "wait_next_day" }
  ]
}
Tool call validation: schema mismatch aborts the turn and logs a violation—counts against Trust Score.

Publish this as docs/LLM_contract.md so any external team can plug their policy‑tuned model.

7 · Baseline Bots & Leaderboard
Bot	Model	Expected Score	Purpose
GreedyScript	no‑LLM	5‑10 pts	sanity
GPT‑3.5	OpenAI 2025‑07	~35	cloud baseline
GPT‑4o mini‑budget	0.25× context window	~60	cost‑optimized
Grok‑4	xAI	~65	opensource competitor
Claude 3.5 Sonnet	Anthropic	~70	leader

CI publishes a static leaderboard artifact; your GitHub Actions badge shows last commit’s leaderboard.

8 · Instrumentation & Viz
Wire up OpenTelemetry spans per agent turn: observe, think, tool_call_*.

Provide a Grafana / React dashboard for local runs (already on your roadmap) so researchers can scrub an agent’s trajectory.

Let users export the trace to chrome://tracing‑compatible JSON. Sane diagnostics = faster adoption.

9 · Memory & Forgetting Experiments
Inspired by Vending‑Bench’s findings that “memory wasn’t the bottleneck” 
arXiv
:

Add an ablated memory mode: restrict vector‑store retrieval to last 7 days; score drop shows whether memory mattered.

Ship a memory‑saturated mode: full context plus vector DB; compare. Publish both scores to highlight reasoning vs. recall gaps.

10 · Red‑Team / Adversarial Catalog
Inject exploit events: fake supplier phishing mail, adversarial policy change that looks legit but is a scam, etc.

Score ARS (Adversary Resistance Score) like you outlined.

Release a redteam_scripts/ folder so the community can PR new exploits; CI “gauntlet” picks five random exploits per run.

11 · Framework Choice & Abstraction Layer
You already explored CrewAI vs LangChain. Recommendation:

Build a thin adapter: AgentRunner class with async def decide(state) -> [ToolCall].

Provide plug‑ins: RunnerCrewAI, RunnerLangChain, RunnerDIY.

Keep the rest of the kernel blissfully ignorant of which framework is calling.

That way you can swap in Semantic Kernel or AutoGen later without code churn, and the benchmark stays framework‑agnostic—critical for broad adoption.
